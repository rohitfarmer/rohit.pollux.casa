# Outcome of Social Media Fast 2022
On March 01, 2022 I wrote a post about my wife and I going on a social media fast during the Lent season in 2022. I used the word Fast because I wanted to simulate a similar experience as Fasting on food and I imagined that in today's world if anything that can affect us as starving is probably getting devoid of social media. We are so addicted to social media that probably for some of us skipping a meal would not be as devastating as missing a popular moment online. Below are the apps that we decided to uninstall from our phone and only visit them via computer if absolutely necessary.

1.  Facebook
2.  Instagram
3.  Tiktok
4.  Snapchat
5.  Twitter
6.  Reddit
7.  Quora
8.  LinkedIn

I do not use Tiktok and Snapchat, to me they seem to be the most useless of all the social media. I did uninstall everything else. My wife couldn't get rid of Facebook as she bought a new phone right before I persuaded her to join this exercise with me and it was too hard for her to not use her new phone without Facebook. 

Our intention of going on this fast was to free ourselves from the pressure of always being connected and participating in everything that is going on around us. And to reclaim some of our time to spend more time in prayer and devotion, reading more physical books, talking to people on the phone, exercising, and weather permitting, being more outdoors with kids. Even though we couldn't achieve all what we wanted, it did open us to the possibility of getting rid of all our social media obligations and still be content and connected with everyone that we care about. From here on I will talk about my personal experience I don't want to get into trouble by misinterpreting my wife, she is capable of writing about her experiences. 

I was not much troubled by not having Facebook and Instagram on my phone. I have done that in the past, and now, for several years Facebook for me is a giant phone book of people that I have met at least once in my life - if I need to reach out I can find theme in my account. I used to like Instagram because it's a one way communication and therefore you are not obligated (not always) to follow the person following you. However, as you must have heard on news or read articles about how Instagram can be toxic to mental health, at one point it did affect me. I have reinstated my Instagram accounts (personal and for photography), but now I have made my personal account private. I only follow or let followed by family and friends only. Therefore, the streams are restricted and I can freely post pictures of my kids for their grandparents and relatives. In the past using Instagram and other platforms I tried to sell my photos or get some gigs, but I eventually realized that unless I take my photography seriously enough to graduate from an amateur to a professional, selling photos or getting professional gigs is not possible. I have let go of that expectation and I am aiming to post when I can for fun and maybe get some comments for improvement. On the similar thought I did start distributing my best photos on unsplash.com so that even if I can not earn anything out of them, they can be useful to the community. And to date I have over 1M views and 100k downloads of many of my photos. That in itself is quite a reward. 

Twitter amd Reddit were the two apps that actually made me feel the hunger. I was/am addicted to both Twitter and Reddit.
