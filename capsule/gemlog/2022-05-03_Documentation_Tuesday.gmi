# Documentation Tuesday
From March 2022 onwards, I have decided to dedicate every Tuesday to writing documentation, lab notebooks, and other forms of reports at work. The reason being on Tuesdays, I have most meetings, and it's hard to find a reasonable length of uninterrupted time for deep thinking and concentration. Also, throughout the week, I mainly concentrate on coding and quickly look at results to recode further steps. I write comments in the code but do not always note detailed documentation/reports that may reflect the line of thinking. Or summarize the results in a digestible summary of conclusive thoughts. I hope this exercise will be helpful when I look back at my lab books a couple of months or years from now. Or to someone else who takes over my work.
