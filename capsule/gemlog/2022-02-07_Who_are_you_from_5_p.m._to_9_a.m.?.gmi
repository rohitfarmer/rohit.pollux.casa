I am a computational biologist, is that all I am, or more that define me
as a human being than what I do from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m? Historically, we
are defined by what we do professionally. It's a massive part of our
identity, especially for people who pursue a career, such as doctors,
scientists, lawyers, teachers, etc. But what if what we do from 9 to 5
is taken away from us, then what are we left with? Who will we be? What
will be our identity?

I have heard countless times from women who were professionals, and
later, due to marriage, pregnancy, or change in visa status, unable to
work for some time, say that they are not a housewife if they somehow
addressed as such. It shows how important their professional identity
means to them. I can understand this type of insecurity, especially for
women who usually struggle more than men to build their careers to be
addressed as something they tried all their lives not to be. I am sure
most men under similar situations would react the same.

So, that makes me ask who are we from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. when we are not
pursuing our careers? Is our entire being is defined by what we do in
the 8 hours of the day, or is there more to us by what we do in the rest
of 16 hours of the day? So, if I am not a computational biologist, I
would like to ask myself, who am I?

I want to be known as an attractive person to hang out with because he
can talk about a wide variety of subjects or has hobbies ranging from
ham radio to reading books to outdoor activities to photography. Also,
someone who follows an organized religion but is comfortable around
people with various spiritual and religious ideas. Someone who is laid
back and easy-going at the same time sophisticated and cultured. I want
people to know me more than my CV --- not just my friends and relatives
but everyone. I do not want to be labeled just as a computational
biologist; yes, that's what I do to earn my living. I am passionate
about it, and I am excellent at it. But that is not all who I am. I do
and want to do many things from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. in my life.

This also makes me think that if I am not a computational biologist in
an elite government agency, am I a better or more important person out
on the street? Should a person on a lower-paying job be intimidated by
me, or [should he listen to all my opinions even if I am not qualified
on a particular
subject](https://www.thedoe.com/narratives/dont-listen-to-celebs-on-politics)?
If my profession does not define me, I should be on par with everyone
else and then be compared based on our interests and personalities
outside the work environment. That is why God has created us equal, and
we all are also equal under the law in most countries. Both are not
interested in how much money we bring but our actions and conduct.

So, who are you from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m.?
