**Question 1.** How do you know that God exists?\
**Answer 1.** I do not know empirically if God exists as no one has seen
him physically, but I know that His spirit lives. This is similar to the
way we know that music exists. I am not talking about sound here but the
dictionary definition of music *"vocal or instrumental sounds (or both)
combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and
expression of emotion."* In the beginning, music passed on from one
generation to another through the people creating it in front of a live
audience. Later on, it got recorded on media and distributed via selling
the physical copy of the medium or in modern times electronically. This
is how we know that music exists. If there is no one to create music and
there is not a recorded copy of any music left, there would be no
existence of music. The same way I know that God exists because since
the recited history of humanity either in the form of cave paintings,
legends or written documents humans have always believed in some God.
It's not only historical it's present, and it's continuously passed on
to the future generations. Description about God can be found in almost
all forms of communication be it written documents, songs, accounts of
personal encounters, testimonies resulting from miracles, preachings in
public gathering or one to one conversation. At this point, people might
ask what about Sherlock Holmes people have talked about him for ages and
there are books and movies written about him. Did he ever exist? I would
say yes his spirit does live. Even though he is a fictional character
the personality of Sherlock Holmes exist among people and many among us
would not be hesitant to say that they know him as much as they know one
of their friends. Having given Sherlock Holmes as an example, I am not
implying that God is a fictional character instead emphasising that it
is not necessary for something to exist to have empirical evidence.

**Question 2.** If God exists and he loves then why there is so much
suffering in the world?\
**Answer 2.** This is a common question that bogs almost everyone
whether they believe in the existence of God or not. Whenever I ask this
question to myself, I also like to ask if for a moment I do not accept
the existence of God then why there is still so much suffering in the
world? And almost every time the answer is that most of the human
suffering in the world is because of humans themselves. Then the
question arises if most of the human sufferings in the world are due to
human then why do we want to blame God. We tend to blame God because it
is told to us that God is good and He loves us, therefore, if God loves
us and He is all powerful then why can't He remove all the sufferings
from this world? Well God did create us to live without suffering when
he placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. We sinned and brought
suffering upon us. God being loving God did take measures to save us
from suffering, and that is why he sent His son Jesus Christ to protect
us from the eternal suffering of hell. Our pain indeed continues in the
physical world, but through His grace, in the midst, we have an
assurance of comfort and peace.

**Question 3.** You are a scientist, and you believe in God. How can we
trust your scientific findings?\
**Answer 3.** One of the main reasons that I do science is that I don't
have to believe in anything while doing it. Science is not a function of
belief. It doesn't matter how much you believe in the content of your
test tube if the ingredients are not right; the desired reaction is not
going to take place. In my understanding in science you propose a theory
and to test that theory you plan experiments, and from the outcome of
your experiments, you either reject or accept your theory. Moreover,
every scientific research is expected to be reproducible. Therefore if I
am ever asked this question, my response is *"I have peer-reviewed
publications, and if you have doubts about the results that I have
proposed then you can carry out the experiments yourself to reproduce my
results, and if what I have done is meticulously scientific then you
should get the same results."*
