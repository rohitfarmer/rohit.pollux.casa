Group identity is a critical weapon in American politics, if not
worldwide. It is easier to fight for or against a similar group of
people than individuals. For example, you are either white or a person
of color in the USA. In the past, persons of color essentially meant
black folks, but now it encompasses everyone who is not white. I always
wonder how white is not considered a color? Scientifically it's a
combination of all the colors in the visible light spectrum.
People-of-color term general points to how a group of people (all
people-of-color) are victims of white supremacy in the western world.

I do not want to be included in the people-of-color group. I would
instead be called an Indian because that is my true identity. No matter
where I live, I will always be an Indian. Yes, I do and behave in a
certain stereotypical Indian way. And that is more acceptable to me than
to be diluted in a group of people based on skin color. I do not share
as much with black folks or people from Latin America or other
brown-colored nations as with another Indian, even if he is from the
polar opposite part of India. I am also not a victim of the things that
people-of-color are associated with. I do not think, in general, a white
person with a similar level of education or wealth has any more
privileges than I have. Does he get an extra orange? Or does he gets
more free books from the public library? Or does he pay less for the
gas, health insurance, rent, and public transport? Indeed, we all have
an unfair advantage in some aspects of our lives because of our
education, our family, or the country we belong to. But just because I
am not white doesn't make me a victim automatically.

My unfair advantage is that I do not have any student loans to be paid
off. In contrast, many of my white colleagues are still paying off their
student loans well into their late thirties and some even in their
mid-forties. Ever since I was in the USA or in the UK, I have been
helping my white friends financially and otherwise as my Indian friends
back home. And I find them as vulnerable and subjected to the entropy of
life as us, the so-called "people of color."

However, American politics constantly enforces that people of color
(collectively) are disadvantaged. Which I think is an attempt to boost
their agenda by pooling people from multiple backgrounds under one
umbrella --- to gain statistical significance rather than addressing the
ground truth. So, yes, there are genuine victims and proponents of
racism, and those individuals should be addressed individually, not
collectively.

I have never come across any Indian struggling financially or socially
in my inner and wide circle in the USA. Yes, the immigration system is a
pain, and I wish I don't have to deal with it as much. But all the
Indian families I know are well educated, pay their taxes, their
children go to good schools, can afford healthcare, and continuously
progressing in both professional and personal lives. Look at the newly
minted Indian CEOs of all the big tech companies in the USA --- and many
more to come. How can we then include Indians in the people-of-color
category to justify that they are going through the same ordeal as a
black person in the USA? It seems both unfair to black people and
factually incorrect.

I find it offensive to be included in the people-of-color group. If I am
to be labeled, please call me an Indian.
